- **Text Generation**: LM Studio API integration

## LM Studio Integration

This project supports integration with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) to provide higher quality answer generation.

Steps to use:
1. Install LM Studio locally and start the server
2. Make sure LM Studio is listening on http://localhost:1234
3. Configure the API endpoints in `config.py`
4. Start the LM Studio Server

If LM Studio cannot be connected, the system will automatically display an error message.
